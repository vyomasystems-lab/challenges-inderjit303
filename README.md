## Verification Environment (Level 1 Design 1)

The [CoCoTb](https://www.cocotb.org/) based Python test is developed as explained. The test drives inputs to the Design Under Test (mux module here) which takes in 5-bit select input *sel*, 1-bit inputs *inp0* to *inp30* and it gives 1-bit output *out*.

A cocotb Testbench is created for each individual inputs *inpo* to *inp30*. 
In each cocotb test, the inputs are first assigned values and then are driven as follows:

```
 Inp0 = 1
 SEL = 0
```

```
 # input driving 
 dut.sel.value = SEL
 dut.inp0.value = Inp0
```

31 such cocotb tests are created for testing all states of input and monitoring output.

The assert statement is used for comparing the multiplexer's output to the expected value and the cocotb log command display's the user typed message as shown below:

The following error's are observed:

**Error 1**
```
test12_basic_mux failed
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/workspace/challenges-inderjit303/level1_design1/test_mux.py", line 236, in test12_basic_mux
assert dut.out.value == Inp12, f"Muliplexer output is incorrect: {dut.sel.value} != 12"
AssertionError: Muliplexer output is incorrect: 01100 != 12
```

**Error 2**
```
test30_basic_mux failed
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/workspace/challenges-inderjit303/level1_design1/test_mux.py", line 560, in test30_basic_mux
assert dut.out.value == Inp30, f"Muliplexer output is incorrect: {dut.sel.value} != 30"
AssertionError: Muliplexer output is incorrect: 11110 != 30
```

## Test Scenario **(Level 1 Design 1)**
Cocotb tests are created for testing all states of input and monitoring outputs purposes. This makes sure that all the inputs are compared with expected output and DUT output. 

The following cases reveals incorrect outputs for 2 such inputs cases: 

Case 1: 
- Test inputs: Inp12 = 1 and SEL = 12
- Expected Output: out = 12
- Observed Output in the DUT dut.out.value != Inp12 != 12

Case 2: 
- Test inputs: Inp12 = 1 and SEL = 30
- Expected Output: out = 30
- Observed Output in the DUT dut.out.value != Inp30 != 30

Output mismatches for the above inputs proving that there is a **design bug in Level 1 Design 1**

## Design Bug (Level 1 Design 1)
Based on the above test input and analysing the design, two bugs in the code were detected as discussed below: 

```
5'b01101: out = inp12;     ====> BUG 1
5'b01101: out = inp13;
5'b01110: out = inp14;            
```

For the mux design, the logic should be '5'b01100: out = inp12' instead of '5'b01101: out = inp12' as in the design code.

```
5'b11100: out = inp28;
5'b11101: out = inp29;
default: out = 0;          ====> BUG 2
```

For the mux design, the logic should be '5'b11110: out = inp30' instead of 'default: out = 0' as in the design code.


## Design Fix (Level 1 Design 1)
Updating the verilog design code and re-running the test makes the test pass.

![l1d1_image6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99788755/182022235-bd16f2d3-8efd-462f-9e0b-120b8c50d833.png)

The updated design is updated in the folder 'fixed_level1_design1'

## Verification Strategy (Level 1 Design 1)
As explained in test scenarios above, bug free verilog code is updated in folder named **fixed_level1_design1**.
The following bugs were detected and corrected.

Case 1: 
- Test inputs: Inp12 = 1 and SEL = 12
- Expected Output: out = 12
- Observed Output in the DUT dut.out.value = Inp12 = 12

Case 2: 
- Test inputs: Inp12 = 1 and SEL = 30
- Expected Output: out = 30
- Observed Output in the DUT dut.out.value = Inp30 = 30

Output matches for the above inputs proving that **Level 1 Design 1 is bug free**

![l1d1_image5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99788755/182021868-8bf24130-1865-4fdd-a2f5-2fca44ae3207.png)

## Is the verification complete for Level 1 Design 1 ?   
The bugs present in original verilog code were detected using cocotb testbench verification on level1_design1 MUX code. 
The bugs were located in code and updated bug-free. The same Cocotb test which detected the bugs, now with modified changes in the code, passes without committing any errors.
Hence, the verification of Mux Level 1 Design 1 is complete.

## Verification Environment (Level 1 Design 2)

The [CoCoTb](https://www.cocotb.org/) based Python test is developed as explained. The test drives input sequence of bits to the Design Under Test (seq_detect_1011 module here) which takes in 1-bit input *clk*, *reset*, *inp_bit* and it gives 1-bit output *seq_seen*.

A cocotb Testbench is created to detect the input sequence pattern 1011. Sequence detector accepts input *inp_bit* a string a bits either 0 or 1. The output *seq_seen* goes high when the target sequence *1011* has been detected with overlap sequence. 

In cocotb testbench, the inputs are first assigned values and then are driven as follows:

![l1d2_image3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99788755/182026472-14d29353-abd1-407a-bf04-392bdb521470.png)

Next, a 10us period clock is created on port clk and clock is started with reset. Cocotb tests are created for the input sequence *1101111*

![l1d2_image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99788755/182026315-cc3e90d8-3b41-4d84-a3c9-d01812fd9aaa.png)


The assert statement is used for comparing the current state value to the expected sequence 1011 and the cocotb log command display's the user typed message as shown below:

![l1d2_image4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99788755/182026399-0140428f-a820-4503-8587-a7aa8324d9f4.png)


The following error's are observed:

**Error message**
```
test_seq_bug failed
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/workspace/challenges-inderjit303/level1_design2/test_seq_detect_1011.py", line 78, in test_seq_bug
assert dut.current_state.value == dut.SEQ_1011.value, f"Sequence must be detected but is not detected {dut.current_state.value}!= {dut.SEQ_1011.value}"
AssertionError: Sequence must be detected but is not detected 000!= 4
```

## Test Scenario **(Level 1 Design 2)**
Cocotb tests are created for testing all states of input and monitoring outputs purposes. This makes sure that the input sequence are compared with expected output and DUT output.

![l1d2_image6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99788755/182026718-6ac98353-878a-428b-8665-33856b524d75.png)


The following cases reveals incorrect outputs for following input sequence cases: 

- Test input sequence: *1101111*
- Expected Output: seq_seen = 1 or dut.SEQ_1011.value = 4
- Observed Output in the DUT i.e Sequence must be detected but is not detected if dut.current_state.value != dut.SEQ_1011.value 

Output mismatches for the above inputs proving that there is a **design bug in Level 1 Design 2**

![l1d2_image5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99788755/182026652-191b1c45-40bd-4cbc-8d2e-4272d4ee6758.png)


## Design Bug (Level 1 Design 2)
Based on the above test input and analysing the design, the following bugs in the code are detected as discussed below: 

```
SEQ_1:
   begin
      if(inp_bit == 1)
        next_state = IDLE;   ====> BUG 1
      else
        next_state = SEQ_10;   ====> BUG 2
    end
```

For the sequence detector design, IDLE and SEQ_10 should be interchanged in the design code. 


## Design Fix (Level 1 Design 2)
Updating the verilog design code and re-running the test makes the test pass.

![l1d2_image7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99788755/182026727-cd48515e-366c-4ccc-b2cb-34490df96dd9.png)


The updated design is updated in the folder 'fixed_level1_design2'

## Verification Strategy (Level 1 Design 2)
As explained in test scenarios above, bug free verilog code is updated in folder named **fixed_level1_design2**.
The following bugs were detected and corrected.

```
SEQ_1:
   begin
     if(inp_bit == 1)
       next_state = SEQ_10;
       // this statement causes bug in the code
     else
       next_state = IDLE;
       // this statement causes bug in the code
    end
```

Sequence 1011 is detected proving that **Level 1 Design 2 is bug free**

![l1d2_image8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99788755/182026698-6d8e7a17-a4c0-4ee2-9fd7-3765f61d81de.png)


## Is the verification complete ?   (Level 1 Design 2)
Yes, the bugs were detected using cocotb testbench on level1_design2 Sequence detector code. 
The bugs were located and rectified. The same Cocotb test which detected the bugs, now with modified changes in the code, passes without committing any errors.
Hence, the verification of Sequence Detector Level 1 Design 2 is complete.

# Level 2 Design (Bitmanipulation co-processor)

The verification environment is setup using [Vyoma's UpTickPro](https://vyomasystems.com) provided for the hackathon.


## Test Scenario **(Level 1 Design 1)**
Cocotb tests are created for testing most of the instructions states.


Following is the testbench which catches the bug in Level 2 Design: 

```

# Test 3   
@cocotb.test()
def run_test_3(dut):

    # clock
    cocotb.fork(clock_gen(dut.CLK))

    # reset
    dut.RST_N.value <= 0
    yield Timer(10) 
    dut.RST_N.value <= 1
